# partycoloR

The goal of partycoloR is to extract color information from Wikipedia articles of political parties. Party colors play a crucial role in visually identifying political parties.
The function `wikipedia_party_color` extracts the party color code (HEX code or HTML color name) from webscraped English Wikipedia political party pages. 
The input argument needs to be a list and the function generates a data frame / tibble.

## Installation

You can install the released version of partycoloR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("lwarode/partycoloR")
```
