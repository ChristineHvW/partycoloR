# partycoloR

The goal of partycoloR is to extract color information from Wikipedia
articles of political parties. Party colors play a crucial role in
visually identifying political parties. The function
`wikipedia_party_color` extracts the party color code (HEX code or HTML
color name) from webscraped English Wikipedia political party pages. The
input argument needs to be a list and the function generates a data
frame / tibble.

## Installation

You can install the released version of partycoloR from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("lwarode/partycoloR")
```
